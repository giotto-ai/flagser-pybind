Release 0.3.1
==============

Major Features and Improvements
-------------------------------
- Clarity of the code of ``flagser_unweighted`` and ``flagser_weighted`` was improved.
- Auditwheel repair is now run in the manylinux jobs.
- ``twine check`` is now run as part of the CI.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fix bug causing ``flagser_weighted``'s output persistence diagrams to be a list of list of tuples instead of a list of ``numpy.ndarrays`` of shape (n_points, 2).

Backwards-Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

Release 0.3.0
==============

Major Features and Improvements
-------------------------------

This is a major release. The whole library has been fully refactored and all functions have been renamed. In particular:

- All functions have been split into an ``unweighted`` and a ``weighted`` version.

  - The ``unweighted`` functions process unweighted graphs. In the adjacency matrices passed to them, off-diagonal, ``0`` or ``False`` values denote absent edges while non-``0`` or ``True`` values denote edges which are present. Diagonal values are ignored.
  - The ``weighted`` functions process weighted graphs. In the adjacency matrices passed to them, the way zero values are handled depends on the format of the matrix. If the matrix is a dense ``numpy.ndarray``, zero values denote zero-weighted edges. If the matrix is a sparse ``scipy.sparse`` matrix, explicitly stored off-diagonal zeros and all diagonal zeros denote zero-weighted edges. Off-diagonal values that have not been explicitely stored are treated by ``scipy.sparse`` as zeros but will be understood as infinitely-valued edges, i.e., edges absent from the filtration. Diagonal elements are vertex weights.

- ``saveflag`` has been split into ``save_unweighted_flag`` and a ``save_weighted_flag``:

  - ``save_unweighted_flag`` focuses on saving adjacency matrices of unweighted graphs into a `.flag` file understandable by C++ `flagser`.
  - ``save_weighted_flag`` focuses on saving adjacency matrices of weighted graphs into a `.flag` file understandable by C++ `flagser`.  It now takes a ``max_edge_weight`` argument. All edge weights greater than that value will be considered as infinitely-valued, i.e., absent from the filtration.

- ``loadflag`` has been split into ``load_unweighted_flag`` and a ``load_weighted_flag``.

  - ``load_unweighted_flag`` focuses on loading ``.flag`` files as adjacency matrices of unweighted graphs.
  - ``load_weighted_flag`` focuses on loading ``.flag`` files as adjacency matrices of weighted graphs. It now take an ``infinity_value`` parameter which is the value to use to denote an absence of edge. It is only useful when the output adjacency matrix is set to be a ``numpy.ndarray`` by passing `fmt` as ``'dense'``. If ``None``, it is set to the maximum value allowed by the passed `dtype`.

- ``flagser`` has been split into ``flagser_unweighted`` and a ``flagser_weighted``.

  - ``flagser_unweighted`` focuses on the computation of homology and outputs Betti numbers, cell counts per dimension, and Euler characteristic.
  - ``flagser_weighted`` focuses on the computation of persistent homology  and outputs persistence diagrams, Betti numbers, cell counts per dimension, and Euler characteristic. It now takes a ``max_edge_weight`` argument. All edge weights greater than that value will be considered as infinitely-valued, i.e., absent from the filtration.

Additionally,

- The documentation have been strongly improved both in docstrings and in the code.
- The handling of default parameters has been improved and warnings are now issued.
- Sparse matrix efficiency warnings have been turned off (``lil_matrix`` cannot be used because it ignores explicitly set 0 values).
- Core functions to transform an adjacency matrix into the data structures understood by C++ ``flagser`` have been moved to the new ``_utils.py``.
- Tests have been extended according to cover the new functionalities.

Bug Fixes
---------

The following bug fixes were introduced:

- A bug fix from C++ ``flagser`` on ``vertex_degree`` filtration has been propagated to pyflagser.
 
- A bug in the C++ ``flagser`` bindings causing persistence diagrams and cell counts to be wrong based on the values of ``min_dimension`` and ``max_dimension`` has been fixed.
 
- Tests were updated accordingly and `conftest.py` has been improved.
 
- Bugs in the ``pyflagser`` ``flagser`` functions causing incompatibilities with sparse matrix and non-float datatype have been fixed.
 
- ``CMakeLists`` has been updated to use C++14. This addresses problem when compiling on MacOS.

Backwards-Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

The library has been fully refactored, which means that most changes were backwards-incompatible. In particular:

- All functions have been renamed as they now include an ``unweighted`` and a ``weighted`` version.
- The ``flag_matrix`` argument have been renamed ``adjacency_matrix``.

Release 0.2.1
==============

Major Features and Improvements
-------------------------------

``CMakeLists`` updated to enable compile flags on MSVC. This improves performance on Windows systems.

Bug Fixes
---------

Hotfix addressing multiples issues where forwarding arguments to C++ ``flagser``:

- ``filtration`` was not correctly forwarded and it always fallback to zero filtration.
- ``max-dim`` and ``min-dim`` were always equal to 0.

``CMakeLists`` updated to disable AVX instructions. This addresses incompatibilities observed with specific hardware setups.

Release 0.2.0
==============

Major Features and Improvements
-------------------------------

The ``flagser`` method now accepts ``filtration`` as an argument. All filtrations available for the C++ flagser software can be used.

Bug Fixes
---------

Fixed bug related to the generation of a file by C++ ``flagser``. Whenever pyflagser's ``flagser`` method was interrupted, it would not remove the generated file, which would prevent the ``flagser`` method to be called again.

Release 0.1.0
==============

Initial release of ``pyflagser``.

Major Features and Improvements
-------------------------------

The following methods where added:

-  ``loadflag`` enable the user to load a ``.flag`` file into a ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` matrix.
-  ``saveflag`` enables the user to save a ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` matrix into a ``.flag`` file.
-  ``flagser`` computes the persistent homology of directed/undirected flag complexes.
